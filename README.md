# Spacialist

Spacialist is a customizable Web-based platform for collecting, managing, analyzing and publishing research data with a focus on the integration of object-related and spatial data for the digital humanities.

## Installation

Installation procedures and system requirements are described [here](INSTALL.md).
**Important!** Please read the installation file before any update for breaking changes or any other important steps that may **break the update**!

## Plugins (Beta)

Since Release _Isfahan_ Spacialist is extensible by plugins. If you are a developer and want to create your own plugin, please refer to this [HowTo Guide](PLUGINS.md).

A list with all available plugins is **coming soon**.

## Testing

All PHPUnit tests are based on the `DemoSeeder` seed. To run tests, follow these steps:

1. Create a new database and a `.env.testing` file (`cp .env .env.testing`) and reference the DB in your `.env.testing`.
2. Run `php artisan test:refresh` This will:
    1. Run migrations `php artisan migrate --env=testing`
    2. Run seeds `php artisan db:seed --class=DemoSeeder --env=testing`
3. Run `php artisan test` or `vendor/bin/phpunit`

### Run specific tests
You can also run specific tests in isolation:
```bash
# Runs a specific test file
php artisan test --filter NameOfTestFile

# Runs a specific test inside the specified test file
php artisan test tests/Feature/MyTestFile.php --filter testTargetMethod 
```


Note: To re-run all migrations you can use this command `php artisan migrate:fresh --seed  --seeder=DemoSeeder --env=testing`
