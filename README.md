# Spacialist

Spacialist is a customizable Web-based platform for collecting, managing, analyzing and publishing research data with a focus on the integration of object-related and spatial data for the digital humanities.

## Installation
Installation procedures and system requirements are described [here](INSTALL.md).

## Testing
All PHPUnit tests are based on the `DemoSeeder` seed. To run tests, follow these steps:

1. Create a new database and a `.env.testing` file (`cp .env .env.testing`) and reference the DB in your `.env.testing` or, if you don't have/want one, in your `.env` file
2. Run migrations
  a. For `.env.testing`: `php artisan migrate --env=testing`
  b. For `.env`: `php artisan migrate`
3. Run seeds
  a. For `.env.testing`: `php artisan db:seed --class=DemoSeeder --env=testing`
  b. For `.env`: `php artisan db:seed --class=DemoSeeder`
4. Run `vendor/bin/phpunit`
